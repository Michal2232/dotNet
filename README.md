• Windows Store Application
developed using C# language and WPF,using the layer model,which is essentially an online shopping store.
This store is designed to cater to all kinds of customers, as well as perform management operations.
If you are an admin of the store, you have the ability to manage orders, add or remove products, and update the stock levels.
As a buyer, you can add products to your shopping cart, place new orders, and track your previous purchases. Additionally, 
the application includes a simulator mode that demonstrates the standard process of the store, starting from order placement all the way to shipping.
All you need to get started is Visual Studio installed on your computer. 
I recommend beginning with the admin mode and then trying out the buyer mode to place a new order. 
Afterward, feel free to experiment with the simulator mode, which can remain open as you test out the application's features.
Enjoy!

You can visit the store's Instagram page, the link is on the order confirmation page
